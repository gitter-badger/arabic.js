# How to contribute to Arabic.js

- Before you open an [issue](https://github.com/arably/arabic.js/issues) or send a [pull request](https://github.com/arably/arabic.js/pulls), search for previous discussions about the same feature or issue. Add to the earlier ticket if you find one.

- If you're proposing a new feature, make sure it isn't already implemented.

- Before sending a pull request for a feature, be sure about test and make [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/arably/arabic.js) build passing.

- Use the same coding style as the [Idiomatic.js](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js) codebase.

- In your pull request, do not add documentation or re-build the minified arabic-min.js file. We'll do those things before cutting a new release.
